      "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes.\n2. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add it during the last minute of cooking.\n3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper.\n4. When the pasta is done, reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.\n5. Working quickly, add the hot pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Remove from heat.\n6. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta and toss quickly to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.\n7. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately with additional Parmesan cheese and black pepper."
